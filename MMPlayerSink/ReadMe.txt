MofoMojo's Sink v0.1

Let's you issue the /sink command in chat console and have your player, and your camera, sink in water. 

:: FEATURES ::
• This was a simple POC and utility to sink the character to retreive lost items on the bottom of the ocean

:: NOTES ::
• This is not a full or complete experience
• This was just a simple utility mod to sink to the bottom of the ocean and walk around to retreive items that may have been lost

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• BepInEx - 

:: INSTALLATION ::
Place the MofoMojo.MMPlayerSink.dll in your \BepinEx\Plugins folder
Start Valheim
This mod is enabled by default. Modify the .cfg to disable it if you want.

When you're done sinking, issue /sink again

:: UPGRADING ::
There are no upgrades here.

:: UNINSTALLATION ::
Remove the MofoMojo.MMPlayerSink.dll and MofoMojo.MMPlayerSink.CFG file from the \Plugins and \Config folders respectively.

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
• This is achieved by applying a straight downward force to the body of the player and adjusting the camera's m_minWaterDistance distance
• These are reverted when you issue /sink the second time
