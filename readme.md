#Details
##ExploreOnShipRadius
Extends the ship radius when you're standing on a boat. I made this because an existing mod didn't work for players on the boat, just piloting the boat.

##PlayerMiniMapMod
Allows you to toggle the minimap and specify independent scaling of the minimap marker and the large map marker

##RecipeTweaks
FishingRodRecipe requires Wood and LinenThread. Yes, this is fairly late game and you probably already have one by then but thematically it makes sense. 
* Bait requires raw Neck meat
* Chains requires 4 iron
* LoxMeatSurprise requires CarrotSoup and LoxPie
* BronzeTweak gives you 3 bronze for 1 tin and 2 copper, or 15 for 5 tin and 10 copper

##ShowPlayerStatsInRange 
PlayerStats will show health data for all nearby players within a given range of you. It allows you to configure various health and healthpercentage levels with customizable levels of criticality. As for coloring, the most critical level wins. In other words, if your health is considered critical, but your health percentage is Medium, then stats are colored with critical coloring. if your health percentage is critical, but your health level indicates it should be normal then the coloring will be critical.

Default color levels are from Normal to Critical:

* Green
* White
* Yellow
* Red

##Wishbone tweak
Allows the wishbone to track on Copper and Tin

##Personal tweaks
Birds drop an additional 1-3 feathers
Fishing in the ocean biome provides 1-3 extra fish
Remember the IP address and port of the last server you connected to
