# MofoMojo's Mods

##ExploreOnShipRadius
Extends the ship radius when you're standing on a boat. I made this because an existing mod didn't work for players on the boat, just piloting the boat.

Allows you to toggle the minimap and specify independent scaling of the minimap marker and the large map marker

Adds a few recipes and tweaks
* Lox Meat Surprise recipe

* Fishing Bait Recipe
* Chains (4 iron = 1 chain)
* Bronze tweaks (1 Tin/2 Copper = 3 Bronze and 5/10 = 15)
